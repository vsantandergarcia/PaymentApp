# PaymentApp

You are going to create a payment flow that will have three distinct screens:
- Contact list selection screen:
You will list both your phone contacts and the first 50 characters from the marvel API and order them all alphabetically. Each row should show name, phone (if applies) and avatar.
List should let you select various contacts.
- Amount selector screen:
This screen should let you write an euro amount of maximum 1000 â‚¬. Decimals should be allowed.
- Confirmation screen:
List the total amount, the contacts selected in the first screen and, aligned to each contact, the amount for each (total amount / number of contacts selected).
